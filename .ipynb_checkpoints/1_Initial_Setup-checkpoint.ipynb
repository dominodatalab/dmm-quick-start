    "\n",
    "(1) Set up your external storage outside of Domino (in AWS, Azure, GCP, Snowflake or HDFS). Note that to set up a Monitoring Datasource, you will need your key / password for that datsource. Note the location for monitoring files in your data source (e.g. bucket name, database name, container etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you do not have those credentials, contact your Admin and ask them to add the datasource to Domino Model Monitoring and grant you access to the data source in the Domino Workbench using a service account.*\n",

    "(2) Add the datasource to Domino Model Monitoring. Note the model monitoring \"Data Source Name\" when you create it, this will be used to access the datasource.\n",
