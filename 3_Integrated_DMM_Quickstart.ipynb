    "\n",
    "Integrated model monitoring is intended to be used when the model itself deployed as a model API within your Domino cluster. This notebook walks through:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Registering the training data snapshot used for training the model as a TrainingDataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Adding in the Prediction Capture Client to your model, and deploying the model as a Domino Model API. This allows Domino to automatically capture the scoring data & model predictions for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Setting up integrated Domino Model Monitoring for your Model API. \n",
    "\n",
    "(4) (Optional) Attaching a Domino Model Monitoring datasource for ingesting ground truth labels. To automate this step, the notebook walks through setting up a scheduled job to send ground truth labels to the datasource so that Domnino can monitor the model's accuracy over time."

    "\n",
    "1) Ensure the first batch of predictions have been ingested into your new model. A new Domino Dataset called \"prediction_data\" should be created and populated with a folder containing the initial prediction data captured.\n",
    "3) In this Workspace, navigate to the \"prediction_data\" Domino dataset (under \"/mnt/data/prediction_data\"), copy the file path to one of the parquet files in there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The path should be formatted like this:\n",

    "### Automation with Domino Jobs\n",
    "To simulate Domino Model Monitoring over time, you can try out running the following two scripts as scheduled Domino Jobs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripts are in the \"integrated_model_scripts\" directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1) daily_scoring.py**\n",
    "\n",
    "Daily scoring simulates sending data to the model API for scoring. Data is read in, sent to the Domino Model API, and predictions are returned. Domino's Prediction Capture Client captures the scoring data and model predictions. Every 24 hours, the captured data is ingested into the Drift Monitoring dashboard. Note that while this example uses a batch job, integrated model APIs capture both batch and real time data sent to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(2) daily_ground_truth.py**\n",
    "\n",
    "Daily ground truth simulates uploading actual outcomes after the predictions have been made. A scheduled Domino Job writes the latest ground truth labels to an s3 bucket, then calls the Domino Model Monitoring API with the path to the file with the latest ground truth labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "If you schedule these two jobs, be sure that daily_ground_truth.py runs after both daily_scoring.py and the scheduled drift check in DMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggested schedule:\n",
    "\n",
    "daily_scoring.py - scheduled Domino Job at 1am\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Drift check in DMM - scheduled for 2am\n",
    "\n",
    "daily_ground_truth.py - scheduled Domino Job at 3am"
